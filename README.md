# Simple P2P Video Call Application

This repository contains the source code for a simple peer-to-peer (P2P) video call application using WebRTC and PeerJS. The application enables users to make video calls directly with each other without the need for an intermediate server to relay video streams, thus ensuring low latency and high privacy.

## Features

- Direct P2P video calls between users.
- Dynamic peer ID generation.
- Easy connection setup using peer IDs.
- Minimalistic UI for initiating and receiving calls.

## Usage
1. Open the Application: Open the application in two separate browser tabs or different devices.

2. Connect to Peer:
   - In the first tab/device, copy the generated peer ID.
   - In the second tab/device, paste this peer ID into the "Remote Peer ID" field and click the "Call" button.
   - You should now have a direct P2P video call connection between the two tabs/devices.
